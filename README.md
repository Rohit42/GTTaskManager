# GTTaskManager
Created an Android app capable of storing, completing and sharing tasks. It has a screen that if the user has some free time, can input a duration and it will output a schedule for that duration based on function of the estimate length, urgency, physical time to reach a task. App takes advantage of Google Maps API for distance and Google Firebase to store information on the cloud. Next steps will sync with other Georgia Tech students to crowdsource information for classes and estimate times for homework completion. Further steps will use user schedules to plan meetings for group projects.
